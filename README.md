Code from 2020 internship at X Financial. Much of the code is practice and proof of concept. The main project is in parts 7-10, which includes the construction of different types of convolutional neural networks (resnets, resnext, etc.) for comparisons of performance. The repository includes a report named "Internship report.docx" and a presentation made during the internship "Resnet powerpoint.pptx".
